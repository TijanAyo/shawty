// New node concepts: like how the find() method

async kinda looks easier to flow with than promises (But we would see how it goes)

What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
```
it's actually funny... how to add a favicon ðŸ˜… this was actually challenging
but then after lots of googling and stackoverflow, i found that linking favicon
can only be possible if i install a package "serve-favicon"... quite fun figuring that out

And some-other boring stuff ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
